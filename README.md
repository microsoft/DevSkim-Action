# DevSkim

DevSkim is security linter that highlights common security issues in source code.  

The DevSkim GitHub Action outputs a sarif file compatible with GitHub's Security Issues view.

## Usage

You can also specify a number of options to the action.

        output-directory: path/to/output (appended to $GITHUB_WORKSPACE)
        ignore-globs: "**/.git/**,*.txt"
```
